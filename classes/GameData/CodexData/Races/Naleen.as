<span class='header'>The Naleen</span>

<span class='blockHeader'>Appearance</span>
<b>Genders:</b> Male &amp; Female
<b>Height:</b> Most Naleen rise about six feet from the ground, though their full length is often more than twice that from tail to brow.
<b>Weight:</b> A fully grown Naleen could easily weigh several hundred pounds.
<b>Hair:</b> Naleen arms and bellies are covered in a thin fur, usually black, orange, green, or tiger-striped. Their hair grows in a matching color to their body fur, and is worn long, and often braided.
<b>Eyes:</b> Naleen eyes range from red and gold to dark, almost black hues.
<b>Tails:</b> Serpentine and prehensile, Naleen tails are powerfully muscled. Combining the same color as the Naleen’s hair, the tail is used to move silently through foliage or to constrict victims, crushing the air out of them into unconsciousness.

<span class='blockHeader'>Combat</span>
A hybrid of feline grace and serpentine speed and power, the Naleen are the deadly apex predators of Mhen’ga. Their attacks are lightning quick and often debilitating, as the Naleen dart into close combat to bite and claw their victims, wearing them down before a potent paralytic poison can be applied by bite to the victim. Once debilitated, the Naleen will coil around the subject, constricting it with its powerful tail before mating begins. Naleen will force themselves on their coiled victims, often raping them for hours on end until they're satisfied. This Naleen sexual predation does not seem to be for reproductive purposes: rather, the playful predators seem to take genuine enjoyment from the act, and will happily hunt members of their own sex, or even automated scout mechs sent into the deep jungle.

<span class='blockHeader'>Typical Environments</span>
Naleen reside in the deepest parts of Mhen’ga’s endless forests, though usually found near lakes or mountains. With natural camouflage given by their colorful scale and fur patterns, Naleen are able to move virtually undetected through their native environs. They are believed to nest in caves or other secluded, dark areas, though a full Naleen nest has never been discovered by any living explorer.

<span class='blockHeader'>Reproduction</span>
Naleen seem to hunt for pleasure rather than reproduction, though it is undoubtable that the latter does occur as a result. They have never been seen to mate with their own kind, though research indicates they may, like Terran snakes, congregate into mating balls of several dozen, or even hundred, members. Outside their own kind, Naleen are often seen accosting Zil, often dragging several of the wasp-like creatures back to their lairs. Half-Naleen, half-Zil have from time to time been reported, though these winged snake-cat-wasp creatures are rare and cumbersome. As far as recorded observation goes, female naleen seem to have standard humanoid reproductive organs while males are reported to sport two reptilian-like phalluses each.

<span class='blockHeader'>Other Observations</span>
Naleen are a strange hybrid race: feline predator from waist to neck with human-like faces and reptilian, slitted eyes. From the waist down, they’re snake-like monopeds, slithering across the floor of the jungle. They possess razor-sharp claws and a venomous bite that can paralyze a victim, though the bite seems to be reserved for wounded targets on the brink of collapse, rather than a primary offense.
